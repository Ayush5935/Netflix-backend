Sure, let's set up Postman to interact with the CRUD operations for movies. Below are the configurations for each CRUD operation along with their respective request bodies.

### 1. **Get All Movies**
- **Request Type:** GET
- **Endpoint:** `http://localhost:3000/movies`

### 2. **Create a New Movie**
- **Request Type:** POST
- **Endpoint:** `http://localhost:3000/movies`
- **Body (raw JSON):**
    ```json
    {
        "title": "The Matrix",
        "genre": "Sci-Fi"
    }
    ```

### 3. **Update a Movie**
- **Request Type:** PUT
- **Endpoint:** `http://localhost:3000/movies/{id}` (replace `{id}` with the actual movie ID)
- **Body (raw JSON):**
    ```json
    {
        "title": "Updated Title",
        "genre": "Updated Genre"
    }
    ```

### 4. **Delete a Movie**
- **Request Type:** DELETE
- **Endpoint:** `http://localhost:3000/movies/{id}` (replace `{id}` with the actual movie ID)

Make sure to replace `{id}` in the update and delete endpoints with the ID of an existing movie.

Please note that for updating and deleting, you need to have an existing movie ID. If you don't have one, you can create a movie first and then use its ID for updating and deleting.
